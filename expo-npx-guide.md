# ðŸš€ Using `npx` with Expo â€“ A Quick Guide

## What is `npx`?

`npx` is a command-line utility that comes with **Node.js** (v5.2.0 and up). It allows you to **run Node.js packages without installing them globally**. This is especially useful for tools like Expo where you may want to avoid version conflicts or unnecessary global installs.

## ðŸ“¦ What Does This Mean for Expo?

Instead of installing Expo tools globally with:

```bash
npm install -g create-expo-app
```

You can use `npx` like this:

```bash
npx create-expo-app myApp
```

### Explanation:
- **`npx`** â†’ Runs the tool directly from the npm registry
- **`create-expo-app`** â†’ Official Expo project scaffolding tool
- **`myApp`** â†’ Your new projectâ€™s directory name

## ðŸ›  Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a new Expo app
npx create-expo-app myCoolProject

# 2. Navigate to your project
cd myCoolProject

# 3. Start the development server
npx expo start
```

## ðŸ“‚ Optional: Update `.zshrc` for Expo

```zsh
# Add Expo CLI tools to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"

# Optional Alias
alias expostart="npx expo start"
```

Then reload your terminal:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
