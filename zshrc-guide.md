# ‚öôÔ∏è Understanding the `.zshrc` File ‚Äì Z Shell Configuration Guide

## üìå What is `.zshrc`?

The `.zshrc` file is a **configuration file for Zsh (Z Shell)**, which is a powerful and customizable Unix shell, often used in place of Bash. The file is located in your home directory:

```
~/.zshrc
```

This file is **automatically executed every time a new Zsh session starts**‚Äîfor example, when you open a new terminal window or tab.

## üßæ What Can `.zshrc` Do?

The `.zshrc` file allows you to customize your terminal environment by defining:

- **Environment variables**
- **Command aliases**
- **Prompt styling and themes**
- **Plugin and framework settings (e.g., Oh My Zsh)**
- **Path management for tools like Node.js, Python, Expo, etc.**
